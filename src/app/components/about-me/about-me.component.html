                        Hey guys, I'm a front-end developer with a background as
                        an automotive master mechanic. Over the years, my
                        experience has taught me logical and analytical
                        thinking, which I now apply to my work as a developer. I
                        use my skills to analyze complex systems and develop
                        efficient solutions. I also value precision and
                        attention to detail, which I apply to my projects. I've
                        always been fascinated by technology and love learning
                        the latest tech trends and advancements. This love for
                        technology finally led me to pursue a career in the tech
                        industry.
